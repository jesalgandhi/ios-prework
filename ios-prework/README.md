App Idea
I’m thinking of creating a productivity-focused iOS app inspired by the Brick product, which uses a physical
NFC tag to lock access to distracting apps until you scan the tag to unlock them. I recently found an
open-source alternative called [Broke](https://posts.oztamir.com/broke-an-open-source-alternative-to-brick/) 
that I could build upon. In addition to the existing functionality, I’d
love to implement an emergency override/cooldown feature for genuine urgent needs, provide analytics and 
insights about blocked/unblocked times, and add a gamification/rewards element to keep motivation high. 
Finally, I could either fork the Broke app to get a head start or start my own project from scratch, using 
Broke’s approach as inspiration.

## Notes

Was a bit confused on how to change text color, but managed to figure it out by creating 
@IBOutlet for each label, then changing the textColor of each of those.
